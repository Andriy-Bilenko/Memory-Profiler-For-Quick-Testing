# Memory Profiler for Quick Testing  
*A lightweight malloc/free/calloc/realloc profiler written in C*

## üöÄ Overview  
This project provides a lightweight memory profiling tool designed for quick testing and debugging. It helps you track memory allocations and deallocations (`malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free`) to identify memory leaks or unexpected heap usage in your code.

The profiler is **written in C**, making it compatible with both C and C++ projects. It was specifically created as a utility to debug scenarios where C++ code used `malloc` instead of `new`, and overloading `new` was ineffective. Since `malloc`-style memory functions are universal, this profiler works 100% of the time.

> **Note**: This utility is intended for **tinkering and debugging purposes only**, not for production use. It introduces some overhead and overrides the default memory functions, which might not align with production requirements.

## üìÇ Features  
- **Universal Tracking**: Monitors `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free` usage.  
- **Minimal Overhead**: Designed for debugging without heavy profiling tools.  
- **Simple Integration**: Just include `memprof_c.c` and `memprof_c.h` in your project.  
- **Ease of Use**: Plug it into your project, include the header, and track memory allocations in a few lines of code (see `example.cpp` and documentation in the header file).  
- **C++ Friendly**: Works seamlessly with C++ code where standard memory allocation operators (`new`, `delete`) seemingly aren't used.  
- **Multithreading Support**: Now supports multi-threaded environments, ensuring thread-safe memory tracking using mutexes.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- **Not Suitable for Production**: The profiler adds overhead and overrides core memory allocation functions.
- **Limited Tracking**: Only tracks up to a predefined number of allocations (`MAX_ALLOCATIONS_TRACKING`).
- **Thread-Safety Introduced**: The implementation now uses mutexes for thread synchronization, but there may still be some minimal performance impact in multi-threaded scenarios. Ensure you understand the overhead of thread synchronization if using this in performance-critical code.
